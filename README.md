## Why Another C2 Framework?

Unlike other C2 frameworks, such as Cobalt Strike, Pico does not offer pre-built listeners or agents. Instead, you have full control over the development process. You can create your own custom listener and payloads, implement a communication protocol that suits your needs, and then integrate these components with Pico using gRPC.

Also, Pico includes its own programming language, [PLAN](https://github.com/PicoTools/plan), which is designed for automating tasks (similar to agressor scripts for Cobalt Strike).
